# ToDoList
The ToDoList app, built on VIPER, enables adding, editing, deleting, and searching tasks. Each task has a title, description, creation date, and status. Data is loaded from dummyjson API on first launch and stored in CoreData. All operations run asynchronously via GCD, and core logic is covered by unit tests.
